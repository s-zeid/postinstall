Files in this directory are the exact output of `dconf dump DIRECTORY`,
but with DIRECTORY and a blank line prepended to the beginning of the
output.  postinstall.sh installs each file using the following code,
executed from within the directory in which postinstall.sh is located:

    for i in dconf/*; do
     if [ "$i" != "dconf/README" ]; then
      tail -n+3 "$i" | dconf load "`head -n1 "$i"`"
     fi
    done
